# JS_PasswordGenerator
The goal of this project was to create an application that provided a random password to an employer based on criteria they've selected ensuring a strong password that provides greater security to the company.

When the Generate buttom is clicked, the employer will choose the lenght of the password, from 8 to no more than 128 characters, and what type of characters(lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special) would like to include in the random password. In case the employer does not choose at least one type of character, an alert will display preventing to generate the password unless one character type is included at least.
Then the random password will be generated taking into consideration the employer choices and it will be written to the page for the employer to copy the random password.
